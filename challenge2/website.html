        <p >Hi, I’m a Web Developer & Designer with a passion for building modern, engaging, and user-friendly websites.<br> I love combining clean code with creative design to craft digital experiences that not only look great but also work<br> seamlessly.
   I specialize in front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks) and enjoy bringing<br> ideas to life through responsive design and intuitive interfaces.On the creative side, I use tools like Figma and Adobe XD<br> to design layouts that focus on clarity, usability, and impact.
     For me, every project is an opportunity to solve problems,<br>  tell stories, and make the web morebeautiful and accessible.  When I’m not coding or designing, I’m exploring new trends<br>in tech and design to keep my work fresh and future-ready.</p> <br>
